In 2018, I launched my web development journey when I helped a friend edit his result card on a webpage. For the past 5 years, I've orbited the software industry, working with an [amazing ecommerce website](https://how2pass.com/), an [Ed-tech startup](https://thetutor.me/), a [digital agency](https://tentwenty.me/), and as a teacher at an [academy](https://itcentre.pk/).

My mission control includes websites, applications, frontends, backends, and designs. I'm fluent in **JS, TS, and PHP**, and I've mastered the art of **responsive design, database navigation,** and  **serverless sorcery.** I'm a big fan of **React, Next.js, Astro** and **Tailwind,** making websites as dynamic as a shooting star.

Currently, I'm on a quest to make the web a more inclusive and accessible place for everyone. I'm also **open to exploring new horizons** for a Sr. Developer and/or Designer position.

When I'm not coding, I'm spending time with family and friends, or I'm sharing my experiences with others. Feel free to send me an email or a DM on LinkedIn or X. Let's chat, and together, we'll reach for the stars! 🚀
